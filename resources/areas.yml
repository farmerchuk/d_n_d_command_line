               you come around a bend, you spot two dead horses sprawled\n
               about fifty feet ahead of you, blocking the path. Each has\n
               several black-feathered arrows sticking out of it. The woods\n
               press close to the trail here, with a steep embankment and\n
               dense thickets on either side."
