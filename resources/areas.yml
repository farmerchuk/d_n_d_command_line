# Area 1: Goblin Ambush

area_1_goblin_ambush: |
  You've been on the Triboar Trail for about half a day. As
  you come around a bend, you spot two dead horses sprawled
  about fifty feet ahead of you, blocking the path. Each has
  several black-feathered arrows sticking out of it. The woods
  press close to the trail here, with a steep embankment and
  dense thickets on either side.
