  description: |
    You've been on the Triboar Trail for about half a day. As
    you come around a bend, you spot two dead horses sprawled
    about fifty feet ahead of you, blocking the path. Each has
    several black-feathered arrows sticking out of it. The woods
    press close to the trail here, with a steep embankment and
    dense thickets to the north and south.
