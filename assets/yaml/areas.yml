    You've been on the Triboar Trail for about half a day. As
    you come around a bend, you spot two dead horses sprawled
    about fifty feet ahead of you, blocking the path. Each has
    several black-feathered arrows sticking out of it. The woods
    press close to the trail here, with a steep embankment and
    dense thickets to the north and south.

    The goblin trail opens up to a large clearing in the woods. At the north
    end of the clearing you see the opening of a cave. A shallow stream flows
    out of the cave mouth, continuing on past you to the south. To the east
    of the cave mouth, to your right, are dense briar thickets. To your west,
    the clearing eventually fades into more woods.
