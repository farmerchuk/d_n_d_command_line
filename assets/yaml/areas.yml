  introduction: |
    In the city of Neverwinter, a dwarf named Gundren Rockseeker asked you to
    bring a wagonload of provisions to the rough-and-tumble settlement of
    Phandalin, a couple of days' travel southeast of the city. Gundren was
    clearly excited and more than a little secretive about his reasons for the
    trip, saying only that he and his brothers had found "something big", and
    that he'd pay you ten gold pieces each for escorting his supplies safely
    to Barthen's Provisions, a trading post in Phandalin. He then set out
    ahead of you on horse, along with a warrior escort named Sildar Hallwinter,
    claiming he needed to arrive early to "take care of business."

    You've spent the last few days following the High Road south from
    Neverwinter, and you've just recently veered east along the Triboar Trail.
    You've encountered no trouble so far, but this territory can be dangerous.
    Bandits and outlaws have been known to lurk along the trail.

    You've been on the Triboar Trail for about half a day. As
    you come around a bend, you spot two dead horses sprawled
    about fifty feet ahead of you, blocking the path. Each has
    several black-feathered arrows sticking out of it. The woods
    press close to the trail here, with a steep embankment and
    dense thickets to the north and south.

    This will be the introduction for Cragmaw Hideout Entrance.
  description: |
    The goblin trail opens up to a large clearing in the woods. At the north
    end of the clearing you see the opening of a cave. A shallow stream flows
    out of the cave mouth, continuing on past you to the south. To the east
    of the cave mouth, to your right, are dense briar thickets. To your west,
    the clearing eventually fades into more woods.
