      As you finish striking down the last of the goblins, you notice that one of
      them is still alive. He appears to be crawling towards the Northern Embankment.

      You decide the goblin is no longer a threat and choose to have mercy. He
      whimpers something that come across as gratitude and scampers off into
      the woods.

      You interrogate the goblin and learn that there is a secret trail in
      the thicket at the Northern Embankment. This trail leads to a goblin
      hideout where their leader, a bugbear named Klarg, dwells. You also learn
      the following bits of information:
        - Fewer than 20 goblins currently dwell in the lair.
        - Klarg answers to King Grol, chief of the Cragmaw tribe, who dwells in
          Cragmaw castle. Cragmaw castle is about twenty miles northeast of the
          Cragmaw hideout, in Neverwinter Wood.
        - Klarg received a messenger goblin from King Grol a few days ago. The
          messenger told him that someone named the Black Spider was paying the
          Cragmaws to watch out for the dwarf Gundren Rockseeker, capture him,
          and send him and anything he was carrying back to King Grol. Klarg
          followed his orders. Gundren was ambushed and taken along with his
          personal effects, including a map.
        - The dwarf and his map were delivered to King Grol, as instructed. The
          dwarf's human companion is being held in the 'eating cave'.

      You decide that the only safe goblin is a dead goblin and finish him
      off for good. (Players can role play the rest.)
