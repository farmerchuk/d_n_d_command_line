    An unremarkable stretch of road. You arrived from the west. No need
    to go back that way just now. To the east you see the dead horses.
    To the north and south you see steep embankments and
    dense thickets beyond.

    the trail stretchs on inland to the towns of Phandalin, and
    beyond that, Conyberry. To the north and south you see steep
    embankments and dense thickets beyond.

    the dead horses. To the west and east the Triboar trail
    stretches on.

    Triboar trail continues on. To the north and south you see
    steep embankment and dense thickets beyond.
